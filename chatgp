Use these 75 ChatGPT Code Words to get great results instead of writing long prompts

Most people talk to ChatGPT like it’s a person.  
Top users steer it like it’s a machine.

The easiest steering wheel is a code word: a one-word tag you put at the top of your message to force a specific transformation.

Use this format:

CODEWORD: paste your text or request  
(Optional) Constraints: length, audience, tone, format, examples

You can stack them too:

TLDR + LISTIFY + ACTIONS: paste text

**Why this works**

ChatGPT isn’t confused. It’s under-directed.  
A code word turns a vague request into an explicit operation: summarize, restructure, critique, rewrite, decide.

That single constraint reduces randomness, improves consistency, and cuts revision loops.
